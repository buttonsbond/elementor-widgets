This is a plugin that currently adds the following widgets to Elementor for Wordpress

* Habeno mortgage calculator widget - by default it will display the widget, remember to put in your client/partner id in the settings to make sure that anyone that applies as a result will be logged to your account. You can also set the type to either narrow or wide. The default is narrow.

If you don't have a partner ID feel free to use mine which is the default for the plugin. I'll earn a commission if someone takes out a mortgage.
